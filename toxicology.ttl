Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds are well-established respiratory carcinogens utilized in industrial processes. While inhalation exposure constitutes an occupational risk affecting mostly chromium workers, environmental exposure from drinking water contamination is a widespread gastrointestinal carcinogen, affecting millions of people throughout the world. The mechanism of action of Cr(VI) at the molecular level is poorly understood."@en ;

  dc:description "This study aimed to the identification of appropriate description standards and quality criteria for nanosafety. Several standards and guidelines exist but most of them are incomplete or not specifcally designed for engineered nanomaterials (ENM) research. A basic catalogue of descriptive information and quality criteria was generated. In an iterative process, our interdisciplinary team identifed deficits and added missing information into a comprehensive schema. This overview was evaluated by a panel of experts during a workshop. This whole process resulted in a minimum information table (MIT), specifying necessary minimum information to be provided along with experimental results on effects of ENMs in the biological context. 
The MIT is divided into six modules: general information, material information, biological model information, exposure information, endpoint read out information and analysis and statistics. These modules are further partitioned into module subdivisions serving to include more detailed information. A comparison with existing ontologies, which also aim to electronically collect data and metadata on nanosafety studies, showed that the newly developed MIT exhibits a higher level of detail compared to those existing schemas, making it more usable to prevent gaps in the communication of information"@en ;

Biocurators manually curate chemical-gene, chemical-disease, and gene-disease relationships from the scientific literature. This core data is then internally integrated to generate inferred chemical-gene-disease networks. Additionally, the core data is integrated with external data sets (such as Gene Ontology and pathway annotations) to predict many novel associations between different data types. A unique and powerful feature of CTD is the inferred relationships generated by data integration that helps turn knowledge into discoveries by identifying novel connections between chemicals, genes, diseases, pathways, and GO annotations that might not otherwise be apparent using other biological resources."@en ;
