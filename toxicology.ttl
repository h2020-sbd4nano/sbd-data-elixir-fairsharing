This data is used in reseach into how its toxicity may be attributed to epigenetic carcinogenicity. Manually-annotated sample and experiment metadata is included to facilitate FAIR data access. Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds are well-established respiratory carcinogens utilized in industrial processes. While inhalation exposure constitutes an occupational risk affecting mostly chromium workers, environmental exposure from drinking water contamination is a widespread gastrointestinal carcinogen, affecting millions of people throughout the world. The mechanism of action of Cr(VI) at the molecular level is poorly understood."@en ;

Biocurators manually curate chemical-gene, chemical-disease, and gene-disease relationships from the scientific literature. This core data is then internally integrated to generate inferred chemical-gene-disease networks. Additionally, the core data is integrated with external data sets (such as Gene Ontology and pathway annotations) to predict many novel associations between different data types. A unique and powerful feature of CTD is the inferred relationships generated by data integration that helps turn knowledge into discoveries by identifying novel connections between chemicals, genes, diseases, pathways, and GO annotations that might not otherwise be apparent using other biological resources."@en ;
