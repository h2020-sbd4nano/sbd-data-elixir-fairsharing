This information has been extracted from a variety of sources, including other databases, government documents, books, and scientific literature.\n\nThe focus of the T3DB is on providing mechanisms of toxicity and target proteins for each toxin. It is also fully searchable and supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure, and relational query searches. Potential applications of T3DB include toxin metabolism prediction, toxin/drug interaction prediction, and general toxin hazard awareness by the public, making it applicable to various fields."@en;

Several standards and guidelines exist but most of them are incomplete or not specifcally designed for engineered nanomaterials (ENM) research. A basic catalogue of descriptive information and quality criteria was generated. In an iterative process, our interdisciplinary team identifed deficits and added missing information into a comprehensive schema. This overview was evaluated by a panel of experts during a workshop. This whole process resulted in a minimum information table (MIT), specifying necessary minimum information to be provided along with experimental results on effects of ENMs in the biological context. \nThe MIT is divided into six modules: general information, material information, biological model information, exposure information, endpoint read out information and analysis and statistics. These modules are further partitioned into module subdivisions serving to include more detailed information. A comparison with existing ontologies, which also aim to electronically collect data and metadata on nanosafety studies, showed that the newly developed MIT exhibits a higher level of detail compared to those existing schemas, making it more usable to prevent gaps in the communication of information"@en;
